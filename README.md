As a SAP BTP Solutions Architect, I work on developing innovative strategies using SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) to optimize processes, promote digital transformation, and add value to businesses. In the pre-sales department, I work on understanding the challenges faced by companies, creating architectures, and technical proposals, and promoting innovation through SAP BTP.
